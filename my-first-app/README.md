# Project Source
This project is the first project given on the React website [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

It was a Tic-Tac-Toe project. I made the code as clean as I could.

Note that I could not add the react element to html. See the integration with Typescript to see
how to do it. I did not fully understand how it was done....
